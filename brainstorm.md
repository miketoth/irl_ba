## Prior Art
* Project 13
* MobaWars
* Guards of Atlantis
* BattleArena Show
* Krosmaster Arena

## Moba Characteristics
* Towers
* Laning
* Minions
* core/objective
* Items/leveling
* Jungle

## Misc.
* Is it more accurate to think of this as a duel similar to what would happen in lane or at an objective in a moba. 
* Should we have levels? Should we have characters repawn? I feel like this is less of a moba and more of an interesting duel game
